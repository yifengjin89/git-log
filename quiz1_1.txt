PyCharm is my favorite editor because it helps me to edit and improve code without putting extra and effort. It helps to insert indents on new lines automatically. Also, I can use the editor to expand a code block to an expression, format the code and easier to analyze the code and identify the errors while writing code. Moreover, Pycharm support popular web technologies. It's easier for me to write various web app in python like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
